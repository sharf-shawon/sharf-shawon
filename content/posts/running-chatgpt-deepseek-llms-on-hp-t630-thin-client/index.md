Running large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and Llama 2 on a budget-friendly HP T630 Thin Client is an exciting project for AI enthusiasts and homelab hobbyists. While this guide is focused on the HP T630 Thin Client, the same steps can be applied to other thin clients or even a Raspberry Pi. This guide provides a detailed, beginner-friendly walkthrough to set up an Ubuntu Server, install Docker, set up Ollama, and run a web user interface (WebUI) to interact with these models.

## Prerequisites:

- **HP T630 Thin Client**: Ensure your device has at least 8GB of RAM and sufficient storage.
  > **Note**: The HP T630 is a low-end device, and while it can run these models, expect slower performance compared to modern desktop computers. However, it's perfectly capable of handling conversations and basic tasks while ensuring your privacy by keeping everything local.
- **USB Drive**: For Ubuntu Server installation.
- **Stable Internet Connection**: For downloading necessary packages and Docker images.

## Step 1: Install Ubuntu Server on the HP T630

1. **Download Ubuntu Server ISO:**
   - Visit the [Ubuntu Server download page](https://ubuntu.com/download/server) and download the latest LTS version.

2. **Create a Bootable USB Drive:**
   - Use a tool like [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/) (Windows) or the `dd` command (Linux) to create a bootable USB drive with the downloaded ISO.

3. **Boot from USB and Install Ubuntu Server:**
   - Insert the USB drive into the HP T630.
   - Power on the device and access the boot menu (usually by pressing `F10` during startup).
   - Select the USB drive to boot from.
   - Follow the on-screen instructions to install Ubuntu Server.
     - Choose your language and keyboard layout.
     - Configure network settings as needed.
     - When partitioning, you can use the guided option unless you have specific requirements.
     - Set up a username and password when prompted.

## Step 2: Update the System

After installation, it's essential to update the system to ensure all packages are current.

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

## Step 3: Install Docker

Docker allows for containerized applications, making it easier to manage and deploy software.

1. **Install Required Packages:**

   ```bash
   sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common -y
   ```

2. **Add Docker's GPG Key and Repository:**

   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
   sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
   ```

3. **Install Docker:**

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install docker-ce -y
   ```

4. **Start and Enable Docker:**

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start docker
   sudo systemctl enable docker
   ```

5. **Add Your User to the Docker Group:**

   ```bash
   sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
   ```

   After running the above command, log out and log back in to apply the changes.

## Step 4: Install Ollama and OpenWebUI using Docker Compose

Instead of running individual Docker commands, we can use Docker Compose for easier management:

1. **Install Docker Compose:**

   ```bash
   sudo apt install docker-compose-plugin -y
   ```

2. **Create a Docker Compose File:**

   Create a new file named `docker-compose.yml`:

   ```yaml
   version: '3.8'
   services:
     ollama:
       container_name: ollama
       image: ollama/ollama:latest
       restart: always
       volumes:
         - ollama:/root/.ollama
       ports:
         - "11434:11434"
       
     open-webui:
       container_name: open-webui
       image: ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:ollama
       restart: always
       volumes:
         - open-webui:/app/backend/data
       ports:
         - "3000:8080"
       depends_on:
         - ollama

   volumes:
     ollama:
     open-webui:
   ```

3. **Start the Services:**

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

## Step 5: Access the Web Interface

Once both containers are running, you can access the OpenWebUI interface:

- Open your web browser and navigate to `http://<your-server-ip>:3000`.

## Step 6: Running Models

With the setup complete, you can now run models like Llama 2:

1. **Pull the Desired Model:**

   ```bash
   docker exec -it ollama ollama pull llama2
   ```

2. **Run the Model:**

   ```bash
   docker exec -it ollama ollama run llama2
   ```

## Benchmarking Performance

Here are some real-world performance metrics from running various models on the HP T630 Thin Client:

| Model | Load Time | First Response Time | Memory Usage |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|--------------|
| Llama2-7B | ~45 seconds | 8-12 seconds | ~6.5GB RAM |
| DeepSeek-7B | ~50 seconds | 10-15 seconds | ~6.8GB RAM |
| Mistral-7B | ~40 seconds | 7-10 seconds | ~6.2GB RAM |

> **Note**: These benchmarks were conducted with the base 8GB RAM configuration. Response times may vary based on prompt length and complexity. While not blazingly fast, the performance is perfectly adequate for personal use and experimentation.

Key Observations:
- Initial model loading takes longer compared to more powerful systems
- Subsequent responses are slower but consistent
- Memory usage stays within the 8GB limit, though it's recommended to close other applications
- Temperature management is good, with the fan maintaining reasonable noise levels

## Conclusion

By following this guide, you've transformed a $20 HP T630 Thin Client into a powerful tool capable of running advanced AI models locally. This setup is perfect for homelab enthusiasts and those looking to self-host AI applications. Remember
