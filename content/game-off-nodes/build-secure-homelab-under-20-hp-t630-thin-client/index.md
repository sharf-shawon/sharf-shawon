## Step 4: Installing Docker and Portainer

**Docker** is a platform that enables you to develop, ship, and run applications inside containers. Containers are lightweight, portable, and ensure that your applications run seamlessly across different environments. **Portainer** is a web-based management tool that simplifies working with Docker by providing a user-friendly interface.

### Installing Docker

1. **Update Package Lists**: Begin by updating your system's package lists to ensure you have the latest information on available packages.

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```

2. **Install Prerequisite Packages**: These packages allow `apt` to use repositories over HTTPS.

   ```bash
   sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common -y
   ```

3. **Add Dockerâ€™s GPG Key**: This step ensures that the software you're installing is authentic and hasn't been tampered with.

   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
   ```

4. **Add Docker Repository**: Add the Docker repository to `apt` sources to fetch Docker packages.

   ```bash
   sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
   ```

5. **Update Package Lists Again**: Refresh your package lists to include the Docker repository.

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```

6. **Install Docker**: Now, install Docker.

   ```bash
   sudo apt install docker-ce -y
   ```

7. **Verify Docker Installation**: Check if Docker is installed and running.

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status docker
   ```

   You should see an output indicating that Docker is active and running.

8. **Manage Docker as a Non-Root User**: To avoid using `sudo` with every Docker command, add your user to the Docker group.

   ```bash
   sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}
   ```

   After running this command, log out and log back in to apply the changes.

### Installing Portainer

Portainer provides a graphical interface to manage Docker containers, images, networks, and volumes, making it easier, especially for beginners.

1. **Create a Volume for Portainer Data**: Docker volumes are used to persist data. Creating a volume for Portainer ensures that its data remains intact across container restarts.

   ```bash
   docker volume create portainer_data
   ```

2. **Deploy Portainer Container**: Run the following command to download and start the Portainer container.

   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 8000:8000 -p 9443:9443 \
     --name=portainer \
     --restart=always \
     -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
     -v portainer_data:/data \
     portainer/portainer-ce:latest
   ```

   Here's a breakdown of the command:

   - `-d`: Runs the container in detached mode (in the background).
   - `-p 8000:8000 -p 9443:9443`: Maps ports 8000 and 9443 of the container to the same ports on the host. Port 9443 is used for accessing the Portainer web interface securely.
   - `--name=portainer`: Names the container "portainer".
   - `--restart=always`: Ensures that the Portainer container restarts automatically if it stops or if the system reboots.
   - `-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock`: Grants Portainer access to the Docker socket to manage Docker.
   - `-v portainer_data:/data`: Mounts the previously created volume to persist Portainer's data.

3. **Access the Portainer Web Interface**:

   - Open your web browser and navigate to `https://your-server-ip:9443`. Replace `your-server-ip` with the static IP address you assigned to your HP t630 Thin Client during the Ubuntu installation.
   - Since it's a self-signed certificate, you might encounter a security warning. It's safe to proceed.
   - On the first visit, you'll be prompted to create an admin user. Set a strong password to secure your Portainer instance.

By following these steps, you've successfully installed Docker and Portainer on your Ubuntu system. With Portainer's intuitive interface, managing Docker containers becomes more accessible, allowing you to deploy and oversee applications with ease.

In the next steps, we'll set up Nginx Proxy Manager to manage your subdomains and configure secure remote access using Cloudflare and Tailscale. 


## Step 5: Installing and Configuring Nginx Proxy Manager (NPM)

**Nginx Proxy Manager** is a powerful tool that simplifies the management of reverse proxies. It allows you to access your homelab services using subdomains (e.g., `service.yourdomain.com`) instead of remembering complex IP addresses and port numbers. This setup not only streamlines access but also provides a centralized point of entry, which is beneficial as your homelab grows.

### Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure that:

- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** are installed on your Ubuntu system.

     ```

2. **Create the Docker Compose File**:
   - Use a text editor to create a `docker-compose.yml` file:
     ```bash
     nano docker-compose.yml
     ```
   - Paste the following content into the file:
     ```yaml
     version: '3'
     services:
       app:
         image: 'jc21/nginx-proxy-manager:latest'
         container_name: npm
         restart: unless-stopped
         ports:
           - '80:80'    # HTTP
           - '443:443'  # HTTPS
           - '81:81'    # NPM Admin Panel
         volumes:
           - ./data:/data
           - ./letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt
     ```
     This configuration sets up NPM to handle HTTP, HTTPS, and provides access to its administrative interface on port 81.

3. **Start NPM Using Docker Compose**:
   - Run the following command to download and start the NPM container:
     ```bash
     docker-compose up -d
     ```
   - The `-d` flag runs the container in detached mode, allowing it to operate in the background.

4. **Access the NPM Web Interface**:
   - Open your web browser and navigate to `http://your-server-ip:81`.
   - Replace `your-server-ip` with the static IP address of your HP t630 Thin Client.
   - On the login page, use the default credentials:
     - **Email**: `admin@example.com`
     - **Password**: `changeme`
   - After logging in, you'll be prompted to change these credentials. It's crucial to set a strong, unique password to secure your NPM instance.

### Setting Up a Proxy Host
