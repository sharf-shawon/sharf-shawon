### Technical Architecture and Implementation

- **Tech Stack Details:**
  - **Laravel:**
    Leveraging Laravel’s robust backend framework, the application efficiently handles complex factory processes, data relationships, and secure authentication.
  - **Bootstrap:**
    Bootstrap drives the responsive front-end design, ensuring the user interface is accessible across devices and intuitive for factory personnel.
  - **MySQL:**
    MySQL powers the database backend, enabling reliable storage, inventory management, and complex production data queries.

- **End-to-End Factory Workflow:**
  From the initial procurement of raw materials (e.g., thread, fabric) to the assembly and production of final backpack products, the system tracks every stage of the manufacturing process. Inventory updates occur in real-time as raw materials are consumed and products are completed.

### Key Functionalities

- **Raw Material Inventory Management:**
  Track and manage raw materials including thread, fabric, zippers, and other components.
- **Production Workflow:**
  Monitor production stages from cutting to stitching and final assembly.
- **Product Inventory Management:**
  Record finished products and maintain real-time stock levels.
- **Order Management:**
  Manage factory orders and link production schedules to fulfill client requirements.
- **User Access Control:**
  Implement role-based authentication to ensure data security and controlled access.

### Challenges and Solutions

- **Custom Client Requirements:**
  The client’s precise and detailed specifications required building custom modules and ensuring every feature aligned perfectly with their operational workflow.
- **Long-Term Maintenance:**
  Supporting the application since 2017 has involved upgrading dependencies, optimizing performance, and resolving any production issues as factory demands evolved.
- **Data Consistency:**
  Implemented validation checks and database constraints to ensure data accuracy across inventory, production, and order modules.

### Conclusion

CitiBags has been a mission-critical system for the client’s manufacturing operations since its deployment in **2017**. It continues to support daily factory processes, ensuring efficiency and accuracy from raw materials to final backpack production. Its longevity and sustained usage highlight the robustness and reliability of the solution.
